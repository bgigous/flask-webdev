Once you have your virtual environment created, then activated, you're ready to install Flask! Double check that your virtual environment is activated, then use `pip` to install Flask:

```bash
pip install flask
```

That's it! You should be good to go with your fresh Flask installation. To make sure everything is A-OK, drop into a python interpreter and try importing the module:

```bash
python
>>> import flask
```

If no errors are thrown, then congratulations, you're now ready to start developing your Flask app! (I know I keep saying that, but really, you're super close.)

Hang on a sec, do you have a good development environment yet? Nonono, not a virtual environment, but somewhere you can type code into and try executing? No? Well, then let's get you set up with VSCode. That'll be the last step in our setup, then you can actually start developing; it's a promise!
