### Folder Structure

Alright, future Flask black belt, the first thing you'll want to do to begin your training is to make a dedicated folder where you'll put all your coursework. The goal here is to make sure you're organized and know where to find your files! So find a good place, but as a suggestion, you can make a new CodingNomads folder in your home folder.

Note: If you're a CodingNomads alumni, you can probably skip this step. Just find where your CodingNomads folder is and pick up at "Create a Git Repo"

```bash
cd ~/Documents
mkdir CodingNomads
cd CodingNomads
```

Once you get that created, go ahead and create three more folders to organize a little further.

```bash
mkdir resources labs projects
```

[//]: # (More?)

### Create a Git Repository

Great! Now that you got the folder creation out of the way, let's move onto making a git repository for your music sharing social network project.

[//]: # (Remember to insert links to Git resources in the course)

First, change directory to your `projects` folder and make a new git repo with the `git init` command. Now you'll have to give the new repository a name. For this project, just name it `flask-webdev`.

```bash
cd ~/Documents/CodingNomads/`projects`
git init flask-webdev
```

Boom, now you have a new `flask-webdev` repo, where you'll soon build an web app from scratch.

#### Make the Github Remote Repository

You'll make a Github repository for your project so you can push your work up to the internets. If you don't already have a Github account, <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">click here to make a free account.</a>

Once you're all set up with Github and are logged in, click the + icon in the top right corner and then click "New Repository."

[//]: # (I'll probably change the name from Ragtime to something that sounds more "code-y". Maybe.)

Now you'll have to give the new repository a name. For this project, just name it `flask-webdev`. Leave the description blank for now, keep "public" selected, and finally, leave "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked.

Click "Create Repository". After that, you'll see something similar to the this:

![New Repository](../images/github_repo.png)

#### Add your new Github repository as a "remote" to your local Git repo

Once you've done that, you'll need to connect your local repo to your Github repo. You'll use the `git remote add` command to do just that. Change into your `flask-webdev` directory and add the new Github remote:

```bash
cd flask-webdev
git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/flask-webdev.git
```

Now, just make sure the remote was added successfully:

```bash
git remote -v
```

If it shows up, great! Now let's make sure it work by pushing your first commit. Send a message to your future self in the form of a `README.md`, or just a general description works too. The message can be anything you want, but make it positive!

```bash
echo "My first Flask app" > README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "First commit"
git push -u origin master
```

If everything worked okay, you should have gotten output that eventually said "Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin." Refresh the Github page to see your commit.

Congrats, you're now all set to keep updating your project to version control! Remember, the `flask-webdev` repo directory we made earlier will be *the* place to keep your first Flask app. Next, you'll ready your virtual environment for the journey ahead.
